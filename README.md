# NetPractice Project 🌐

This project is designed to develop and test our understanding of **computer networking concepts**, specifically focusing on **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, and **routing**.

## Features 📋
1. **IP Addressing:** Learn about different IP address classes and how to assign IP addresses within a network.
2. **Subnet Masks:** Understand and apply subnet masks to divide networks into smaller sub-networks, improving organization and security.
3. **Subnetting:** Master the techniques of subnetting, including calculating the number of subnets and hosts per subnet.
4. **Routing:** Gain insights into routing principles and how data packets are forwarded between different networks.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Develop a solid understanding of IP addressing and subnetting.
2. Learn to apply subnet masks to create and manage subnets effectively.
3. Enhance knowledge of routing and how it is used to connect different networks.
4. Improve problem-solving skills in network configuration and troubleshooting.

## Practical Tasks 🛠️
1. **Assign IP Addresses:** Assign correct IP addresses and subnet masks to various network devices.
2. **Calculate Subnets:** Calculate subnets and the number of hosts per subnet using subnet masks.
3. **Configure Routing:** Set up routing tables to ensure proper data flow between subnets.
4. **Network Troubleshooting:** Diagnose and fix common networking issues related to IP addressing and routing.
